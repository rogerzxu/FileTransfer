To run code, start up the server. Then start up the client. When it asks you, enter "start" into the client to start the file transfer

The formulas/algorithms in the pdf are very unclear, and although we did implement it, we did not understand it fully. Using the pdf formulas, the file transfer works well sometimes, but other times it does not work well. Therefore, we implemented a way in the server to turn on/off the formula. When the server starts up, it will ask you whether you want to use the formula given from the pdfs. If not, it will transfer at a default rate of 25 packets per second.

You also need to change the variables for the file names if you want to test with different files. The default file to be sent it test2.txt and it will be downloaded to download.txt.
